  %|section "Features"

    <%= $project %> is exciting because:

    * It excels at dynamic arrangement of clients, columns, views, and tags.
    * It provides an <%= xref 'shell', 'interactive shell' %> for live entertainment and experimentation.
    * It provides a pure Ruby client for the [9P2000 protocol](<%= p9p_url %>), upon which wmii's [IXP file-system interface](<%= wmii_ixp_url %>) is built.

    These features distinguish <%= $project %> from the competition:
    * [r9p](http://libs.suckless.org/r9p)
    * [Rii](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rii/)
    * [Ruby-IXP](http://home.gna.org/rubyixp/)
    * [ruby-wmii](http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?wmii+ruby)


  %|section "Etymology"

    The word "wmii" is difficult to pronounce because it is an abbreviation, not an acronym.  If we were to treat it as an acronym, the closest pronounciation would be, in my mind, something like "vim-eye".

    Since this is a Ruby library, I added a "roo" and worked it through:

    * vim-eye
    * roo-vim-eye
    * roovm-eye

    And thus we get "Rumai".
