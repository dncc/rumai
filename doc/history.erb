  %|history
    %|section "Version 2.1.0 (2009-05-09)"
      This release improves client arrangement, fixes several bugs, and cleans up the code.

      %|paragraph "Thank you"
        * Simon Hafner reported several bugs.
        * Michael Andrus verified bug fixes.

      %|paragraph "New features"
        * Focus is now restored on the initially focused client after applying <%= xref "Automated client arrangement" %>s.

        * The push(), insert(), and unshift() instance methods of the `Rumai::Area` class now preserve the order of inserted clients.

        * The `Rumai::View#arrange_in_grid()` method now accepts 1 as a parameter.  This invocation causes every column to contain at most 1 client.

      %|paragraph "Bug fixes"
        * Fix error caused by focusing the top/bottom client in the destination area before sending new clients into that area.

        * Fix error when importing clients into an empty area.

      %|paragraph "Housekeeping"
        * Use snake_case instead of camelCase for variable names.

        * Add copyright notice at the top of every file.

        * Plenty of code formatting and beautification.

    %|section "Version 2.0.2 (2009-02-26)"
      This release fixes a connection bug.

      %|paragraph "Thank you"
        * Simon Hafner reported and helped debug the `$DISPLAY` bug.

      %|paragraph "Bug fixes"
        * wmii omits the fractional portion of `$DISPLAY` in its socket file path.  Rumai was trying to connect with the entire `$DISPLAY` value (including the fractional portion) and thus could not find wmii's socket file.

    %|section "Version 2.0.1 (2009-01-25)"
      This release simplifies project administrivia using [<%= Inochi::PROJECT %>](<%= Inochi::WEBSITE %>), improves the unit tests, and revises the user manual.

      %|paragraph "Bug fixes"
        * The <tt>lib/rumai/ixp/message.rb</tt> library's unit test would fail if <tt>/rbar/status</tt> did not already exist in wmii.

      %|paragraph "Housekeeping"
        * Store IXP socket address in `Rumai::IXP_SOCK_ADDR`.

        * Added missing test cases for (TR)create and (TR)remove messages in the unit test for the <tt>lib/rumai/ixp/message.rb</tt> library.
