      This release fixes a connection bug.

      <% paragraph "Bug fixes" do %>
        * wmii omits the fractional portion of `$DISPLAY` in its socket file path.  Rumai was trying to connect with the entire `$DISPLAY` value (including the fractional portion) and thus could not find wmii's socket file.

          Thanks to Simon Hafner for helping me debug this.
