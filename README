Rumai is a Ruby library for manipulating the wmii window manager.
It excels at dynamic arrangement of clients, columns, and views.

It also provides an interactive shell for live entertainment
and a pure Ruby client for the 9P2000 protocol, which it
uses to communicate with wmiiâ€™s IXP file-system interface.
