wmii-irb: Interactive Ruby shell for wmii.
==========================================

wmii-irb is the continuation of my initial attempt[1] at an interactive Ruby
shell for wmii. I try to keep it up to date with wmii's hg tip (the latest wmii
from the Mercurial repository). Thus, it should also work with the latest wmii
snapshot release.

This package has no dependencies on any wmiirc configuration. Instead, it is
meant to be a library through which Ruby-based wmiircs can easily interact with
wmii. In particular, my Ruby-based wmiirc might serve as an example of how the
wmii-irb API is used. You can obtain it here:

  darcs get http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~snk/pub/src/wmiirc/


Setup instructions
------------------

If you just want to try out wmii-irb, simply run the following commands:

# obtain wmii-irb

  darcs get http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~snk/pub/src/wmii-irb/
  cd wmii-irb/

# satisfy dependencies

  svn co svn://svn.gna.org/svn/rubyixp/trunk ruby-ixp

# view API reference

  rdoc *.rb
  firefox doc/index.html &

# run the interactive shell

  chmod +x wmii-irb
  ./wmii-irb

  # type "current" and press TAB
  # type "next" and press TAB
  # type "prev" and press TAB
  # see the API reference for more commands


Patches and feedback are welcome. :-)
